## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the data, code, and results for our research titled **"Cars & Narrow Roads: Less Than A Friend, More Of A Foe: A Multiple Linear Regression Analysis."** This study investigates the relationship between the number of registered vehicles, total road length, and the death rate due to road traffic accidents in the Philippines.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To analyze the influence of:
- **Number of Registered Vehicles**
- **Total Road Length (per year)**  
on the:
- **Death Rate due to Road Traffic Accidents (per 100,000 population)**

---

## ðŸ§  Background
Road traffic accidents are among the leading causes of death for children and young adults, as identified by the **United Nations**. This study aims to support the UNâ€™s goal of halving such accidents by understanding the underlying factors influencing road safety.

---

## ðŸ“Š Methodology
- **Data Sources**:  
  - Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)  
  - CEIC Data

- **Statistical Technique**:  
  - **Multiple Linear Regression** to examine the relationship between independent variables (vehicles and road length) and the dependent variable (death rate).

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- The model results are statistically **significant**.
- Both **Road Length** and **Number of Vehicles** exhibit a **high degree of relationship** with **Death Rate**.
- Areas with high car density and narrower roads are at **greater risk** of traffic-related fatalities.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations
To mitigate road traffic accidents:
- Enhance and modernize **public transportation** systems.
- Reduce dependency on private vehicles while maintaining transportation efficiency.
